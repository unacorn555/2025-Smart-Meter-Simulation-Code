# 2025-Smart-Meter-Simulation-Code

This repository contains code developed for data processing and generation of a Smart Meter Simulation strategy as part of the **"Smart Meter Control for Load Management"** research project.

> **Note:** Sensitive information has been removed to protect privacy and confidentiality.

## Overview

The code in this repository was used to:
- Process and clean smart meter and SCADA data for use in PowerFactory modelling and graphing. 
- Simulate historical load control events based on SCADA data.
- Develop and test a control strategy for peak demand management. 

The simulation approach builds on actual network operational scenarios to model the effects of controlled load on distribution networks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – for data cleaning, analysis, and plotting.
- **DIgSILENT PowerFactory** – for load flow modelling and scenario testing.
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib** – for data processing and visualisation.
